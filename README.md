# PatientsAndGenesInfo
Code in MySQL_genetic_database.py file consists of parts, that are separated by comments.
Creating ClientInfo table from .txt file takes long time, because there is big amount of data.
3 tables were created- Genes up to regulate, Genes down to regulate and CliendInfo.
Each table consists rows with patiend ID and his required info, but required numbers was obtained correctly, taking into account the fact, that rows with same patient ids are counted as 1 patient. 
You need to  update .json and .txt files paths on your device
